Java Programming: A DIY Version of Netflix and Amazon Recommendation Engines

The recommendation engine finds users in the database that have similar ratings and weights their input to provide a more personal recommendation system.

Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, the system can:

Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
Calculate average ratings;
Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
