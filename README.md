Java Programming: A DIY Version of Netflix and Amazon Recommendation Engines

The recommendation engine finds users in the database that have similar ratings and weights their input to provide a more personal recommendation system.

Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, the system can:

Read in and parse data into lists and maps,
calculate average ratings,
calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings, and
recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.
